# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Dashboard

# The coffee shop chain needed a clear and interactive way to answer key business questions:

- Which days and hours generate the highest sales?

- How do sales differ between weekdays and weekends?

- Which store locations are performing best?

- Which product categories and products drive the most revenue?

- How do sales trends evolve throughout the month?

- Which top products should be prioritized for inventory planning?
